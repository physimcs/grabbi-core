# ML Wiki Game
The Wiki Game is a game where a player starts on a randomly selected article on Wikipedia and must navigate through internal Wikipedia links to reach a randomly selected endpoint article.

This project aims to leverage machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), going beyond traditional pathfinding methods, to optimize the Wikipedia navigation process. By incorporating semantic understanding of the articles and their content, the system will intelligently choose the best links to click and navigate through, ultimately reaching the endpoint article faster.

This is more of an exercise in 'can it be done' rather than 'is it the most efficient way to do it'.
